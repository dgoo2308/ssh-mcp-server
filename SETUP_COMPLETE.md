## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Add to Claude Desktop Config
Add this configuration to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ssh-remote-commands": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/Users/dgoo2308/git/ssh_mcp/build/index.js"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Restart Claude Desktop

### 3. Test Commands
Try these commands in Claude:
- `"List my SSH hosts"`
- `"Execute 'uptime' on [your-host]"`
- `"Execute 'ps aux | grep python' on [your-host] with base64 encoding"`

## 🔧 Available Tools

| Tool | Description | Base64 Support |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| `ssh_execute_command` | Single command execution | Optional |
| `ssh_execute_script` | Multi-line script execution | Always |
| `ssh_list_hosts` | List SSH config hosts | N/A |
| `ssh_get_host_info` | Host configuration details | N/A |
| `ssh_upload_file` | SCP file upload | N/A |
| `ssh_download_file` | SCP file download | N/A |

## 💡 Base64 Benefits

### Before (Escaping Nightmare):
```bash
ssh server 'ps aux | grep "odoo" | awk '"'"'{print $2}'"'"' | head -5'
```

### After (Base64 Magic):
```bash
# Command: ps aux | grep "odoo" | awk '{print $2}' | head -5
# Becomes: echo 'cHMgYXV4IHwgZ3JlcCAib2RvbyIgfCBhd2sgJ3twcmludCAkMn0nIHwgaGVhZCAtNQo=' | base64 -d | bash
```

## 🎯 Perfect for Odoo & IoT

### Odoo Operations:
```bash
# Deploy addon
"Upload my-addon.zip to odoo-prod and restart service"

# Check logs  
"Get last 50 lines of Odoo logs from production server"

# Database backup
"Run this backup script on odoo-prod: [complex script]"
```

### IoT Management:
```bash
# Monitor sensors
"Check temperature readings from all IoT devices"

# Update firmware
"Execute firmware update script on rpi-sensors"

# Collect data
"Download sensor logs from the last 24 hours"
```

## 🛠 Development Commands

```bash
# Rebuild after changes
npm run build

# Development mode (auto-rebuild)
npm run dev

# Test base64 encoding
./test-base64.sh

# Run setup again
./setup.sh
```

## 🔐 Security Notes

- ✅ Uses your existing SSH keys and config
- ✅ Respects SSH security settings (ProxyJump, etc.)
- ✅ No credential storage or transmission
- ✅ Base64 eliminates injection risks
- ✅ Configurable timeouts prevent hanging

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Host not found"** → Check `~/.ssh/config` and use `ssh_list_hosts`
2. **"Permission denied"** → Test manual SSH: `ssh your-host`
3. **"Timeout"** → Increase timeout or check connectivity
4. **"Base64 not found"** → Most systems have it, try `which base64`

### Debug Commands:
```bash
# Test SSH connectivity
ssh your-host "echo 'SSH working'"

# Test base64 manually
echo "date" | base64
ssh your-host "echo 'ZGF0ZQo=' | base64 -d | bash"
```

## 🎊 You're All Set!

Your SSH MCP server with base64 encoding is ready to handle complex Odoo deployments and IoT device management without any escaping headaches!

**Happy remote commanding! 🚀**
